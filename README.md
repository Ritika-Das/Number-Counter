# Number-Counter
This counter has buttons to increase, decrease or reset the number value, and a dark/light mode toggle button - live ![here](https://ritika-das.github.io/Number-Counter/).
<br>It has been made using simple DOM manipulation in JavaScript, and minimal CSS.

## Stuff to Try
- Clicking on Minus, Plus and Reset buttons decrements, increments and sets the number count to zero respectively. They get colored when clicked.
- Hovering on the "Number Counter" heading scales itself.
- It has light theme initially, which can be changed to dark by clicking the toggle button with black and white dots.
- To change back to light theme from dark, double-click the same button.
